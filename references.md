I am simply recommending other resources I found useful and interesting when I was taking 40C and upper division E&M.


## [Doc Schuster: Electrostatics & Conductors](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLUpvzaZLf3ItVF6TbBDJvFOTO4RDSGm2) on YouTube.

Great (and funny!) videos covering the first few topics we're covering.  

## [The Feynman Lectures on E&M](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html)

For conceptual understanding of electromagnetism, there's no better resource than Feynman IMO. The lectures go much more in depth than this class requires, but may be interesting to read if you are bored and wondering about the underlying phenomena we are studying in 40C.
